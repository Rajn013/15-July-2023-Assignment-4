    "10. Regularized models strike a trade-off between bias and variance. Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a complex relationship with a simple model. Regularization tends to increase the bias by shrinking the parameter estimates towards zero. On the other hand, variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to fluctuations in the training data, which can lead to overfitting. Regularization reduces variance by limiting the model's flexibility and preventing it from fitting the noise in the training data. The trade-off is that regularized models may have slightly higher bias but lower variance, leading to better generalization performance on new data."
